This is my first attempt at using django and bootstrap. It seems like django is good as a go-between for python and html/css/js, and it seems like django is mostly good for formating responsive webpages.

I'm mostly learning how the directories are laid out when using django. This page uses the 12 columns per the bootstrap default. It also uses {% %} notation for importing block content, snippets, and css.
